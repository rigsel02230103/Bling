#Example 1
x = 5
print(x > 3 and x < 10) #True because both conditions are True

#Example 2
y = 12
print(y > 10 and y % 5== 0) #False because the second condition is False

#Example 3
q = 5
print(q < 5 or q > 10) #False because both conditions are False

#Example 4
w = 12
print(w < 10 or w % 2 == 0) #True because the second condition is True

#Example 5 
r = 5
print(not(r > 3 and r < 10)) #False because the conditions inside the not is True


#Example 6
g = 12
print(not(g > 10 and g % 5 == 0)) #True because the conditions inside the not is False# Example 1
